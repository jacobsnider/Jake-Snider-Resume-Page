JAKE SNIDER RESUME/PORTFOLIO PAGE

CODE LOUISVILLE FRONT END WEB DEVELOPMENT PROJECT GUIDE
=======================================================

This is a pretty straight forward front end project, there are no special requirements to run the site. I utilized Bootstrap and jquery for design and functionality. 

My JS/JQ requirement targets the profile image inside the header with a border CSS transformation along with a click event that rotates the image 180 degrees. 

The project acts as a portfolio to Jake Snider's many talents and experiences as an artist.

The Travel page linked in this project was a previously created Wordpress project.


CAUTION TO THE REVIEWER
=======================
Art is subjective.
Most of this portfolio site contains abrasive, aggressive and loud music - 
or avant gard performances with mature themes.
