CODE LOUISVILLE FRONT END WEB DEVELOPMENT PROJECT GUIDE
=======================================================

This is a pretty straight forward front end project, there are no special requirements to run the site.
The project acts as a portfolio to Jake Snider's many talents and experiences as an artist.
The Travel page linked in this project was a previously created Wordpress project.


CAUTION TO THE REVIEWER
=======================
Art is subjective.
Most of this portfolio site contains abrasive, aggressive and loud music - 
or avant gard performances with mature themes.
